            <hr>
            <p>
                People who want a creative career path may enjoy web development. They can use their creativity skills
                to design layouts for pages that are easy and enjoyable to read. Many developers also use coding to
                produce unique effects for websites. Accepting new challenges, learning different technology, and
                building a technology network.
            </p>
            <h3>What Type Of Website Can I Create For You?</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                I create two types of websites: static and interactive. Interactive sites are part of the Web 2.0
                community of sites and allow for interactivity between the site owner and site visitors or users. Static
                sites serve or capture information but do not allow engagement with the audience or users directly.
            </p>
            <h3>Do You Recommend Us To Your Friends?</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                For sure, we had an easy experience with this company. We didn't have any troubles during their work or
                extra
                payments. We have got an excellent result.
